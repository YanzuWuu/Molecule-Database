1.  Develop an Android client for your database.
2. Run a server for your database that can be accessed through some reasonable interface over a socket port.
3. Implement subgraph search - finding all molecules that contain a subgraph provided.
4. Implement approximate subgraph search - finding all molecules that contain a molecule similar to the given molecule (with respect to a tunable parameter based on a reasonable graph similarity metric).
