# Approximate Subgraph Search

1. Should be similar to Subgraph Search
2. The main problem should be formulating the candidate similar subgraphs
3. So the main point of this part of the problem I guess is comparing graph similarity using techniques like neighbor matching (https://wadsashika.wordpress.com/2014/09/19/measuring-graph-similarity-using-neighbor-matching/).
